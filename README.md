# SwEntApp

Nowadays, we have asserted that conventional social media apps do not fulfill the needs of college students: they promote a great amount of content, decrease real community-based socialisation opportunities and make user engagement-based recommendations which decrease the diversity of views in society.

We want to provide an app which is able to create durable social connections among people and promote face-to-face social interactions, all while adapting to people’s available resources, namely their degree of travelling freedom and their time schedule.

Our app’s main focus will be facilitating event organisation and the promotion of events. The idea is to improve users’ social lives, whether they have lived where they are forever, have just moved to a new place or even if they are just visiting. Events can range from small get-togethers at the beach among friends with a football and a six-pack of beer, to university-organised lectures, to live DJ sets, or to anything private or public that someone comes up with and organises.


## Figma

To help in the design of our application, we will be working on Figma to design the UI and the workflow of the screens of our application. Here is our [project template](https://www.figma.com/files/project/212894999/Team-project?fuid=1232371200308240063).

## Architecture Diagram
To provide a clear overview of how GoMeet is structured, the architecture diagram is essential.
The diagram should present these components in a layered fashion, showing how data flows from the User Interface down through the Application Logic, interacting with the Data Storage, and then out to the External Integrations or back to the user through the Notification System.

## SonarCloud

We are using SonarCloud to analyze our code and to ensure that it is of high quality. Here is our [SonarCloud project](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=SwEnt-Project-G18_SwEntApp).
